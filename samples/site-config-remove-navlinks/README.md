# Remove links from the site navigation list

## Summary

You can use the removeNavLink script action to remove links from the site navigation list. This can be especially useful for removing links that are added by default with the collaboration and communication templates.

In this sample we are removing all of the default links added by the default collaboration (team) template: home, pages, conversations, documents, notebook, site contents.
