In this example we illustrate how you can apply custom column and row formatting to a list. Column formatting is being applied to the "Project Status" field, with conditional iconography and color being applied to the field based on the value. Similarly, row formatting has been applied to the default "All Items" view to format the row background (using the predefined 'sp-field-severity--blocked' class) if the list item is identified with the "Legal" project category.
